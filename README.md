# IP-project-

we need to add something

git add. = stages all of it ( sends all of it)

commit something

git commit -m "add something

git push 


if you use VSCODE gui to add or delete or something, you press plus under stage and press okay

work on different files in IP project 
- otherwise we could end up with merge conflicts

- do smaller commits often
        then you only loose as little as possible after changes
        makes it easier

git branch
- gives you all the branches

git branch "name"
- create new branch

git checkout "nameofbranch"

git branch -d "nameofbranch"
- deletes branch

When making branches and changes and people are working on the same document
- you can experience merge conflicts.
